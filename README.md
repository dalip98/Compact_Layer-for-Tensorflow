# Compact_Layer-for-Tensorflow

Main idea behind creating this Compact_Layer is to - "to fix the repeatability of writing /using the same functions again and again".

We can add the class Compact_Layer() in any package and directly call it by just passing the parameter ,the list of, number of perceptrons required in different layers . 

One line of code  , instead of calling the same functions again and again .
